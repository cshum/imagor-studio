## What Makes Imagor Studio Special?

### Non-Destructive Workflow
All image transformations are URL-based, meaning your original images remain untouched. Generate transformed versions on-the-fly without modifying source files.

### Universal Storage Support
Works with local filesystems, S3-compatible storage, and more. Switch between storage backends without changing your workflow.

### Built on imagor
Imagor Studio is powered by [imagor](https://github.com/cshum/imagor), a fast and secure image processing server that provides URL-based image transformations. Imagor Studio extends imagor with a beautiful gallery interface and live editing capabilities, giving you the best of both worlds: imagor's powerful processing engine with an intuitive visual interface.

All image transformations benefit from imagor's high-performance architecture, comprehensive operation support, and proven reliability in production environments.
